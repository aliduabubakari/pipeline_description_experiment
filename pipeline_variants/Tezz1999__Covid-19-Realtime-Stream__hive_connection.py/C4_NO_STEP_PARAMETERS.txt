Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: Tezz1999__Covid-19-Realtime-Stream__hive_connection.py
- Name: hive_script
- Purpose: Execute Hive database operations including database creation, table creation, and data insertion
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: linear
- Notes: Simple linear workflow with two steps: a shell command execution followed by Hive database operations

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - run_after_loop -> hive_script_task

Data Artifacts / I-O Identifiers:
- table: mydb.test_af (Hive table created and populated by the workflow)

External Systems:
- database: Hive (hive_local)

Pipeline Steps:
1. run_after_loop — run_after_loop
  - Objective: Execute a shell command to display the current user
  - Mechanism: shell_command
2. hive_script_task — hive_script_task
  - Objective: Execute Hive database operations including database creation, table creation, and data insertion
  - Mechanism: sql_query
  - Outputs: table:mydb.test_af

Scheduling:
- Schedule type: cron
- Schedule expression: 00 1 * * *
