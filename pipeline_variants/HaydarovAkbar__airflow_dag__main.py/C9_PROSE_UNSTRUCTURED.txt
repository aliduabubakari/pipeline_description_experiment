WF_MAIN_DATASETS_LOAD_L2_TO_L2 is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern mixed. Its purpose is: Main workflow for loading datasets from DWH L2 to L2 with segmentation processing and SAP integration.

Scheduling: schedule type is manual, start date is 2024-12-22, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: wait_for_l2_full_load→get_load_id; get_load_id→workflow_registration; workflow_registration→wait_for_success_end; wait_for_success_end→run_sys_kill_all_session_pg; run_sys_kill_all_session_pg→run_wf_data_preparation_for_reports; run_sys_kill_all_session_pg→segmentation_group; run_wf_data_preparation_for_reports→end; segmentation_group→end; end→email_on_failure.

get_load_id performs Generate load identifier for the session using mechanism python_callable. workflow_registration performs Register workflow session in metadata system using mechanism python_callable. end performs Finalize workflow session with success status using mechanism python_callable. wait_for_l2_full_load performs Wait for L1 to L2 data load completion flag using mechanism wait_poll. wait_for_success_end performs Wait for previous successful execution completion using mechanism wait_poll. run_sys_kill_all_session_pg performs Trigger session cleanup workflow using mechanism external_workflow_trigger. run_wf_data_preparation_for_reports performs Trigger data preparation for reports workflow using mechanism external_workflow_trigger. email_on_failure performs Send notification email on workflow failure using mechanism notification. load_ds_client_segmentation performs Trigger client segmentation data load workflow using mechanism external_workflow_trigger. send_flg_to_sap performs Send completion flag to SAP system using mechanism python_callable.
