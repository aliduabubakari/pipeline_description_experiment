Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: synthetic-generator-v2__synthetic_branch_merge_02_backup_strategy_selector.py
- Name: backup_strategy_selector
- Purpose: Selects database backup strategy based on day of week (full backup on Saturday, incremental backup on weekdays)
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: branch_merge
- Business domain: database maintenance
- Notes: Implements a branch-merge pattern for database backups with conditional routing

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - start_backup_process -> date_check_task
  - date_check_task -> full_backup_task
  - date_check_task -> incremental_backup_task
  - full_backup_task -> verify_backup_task
  - incremental_backup_task -> verify_backup_task
  - verify_backup_task -> backup_complete

External Systems:
- database: database

Pipeline Steps:
1. start_backup_process — start_backup_process
  - Objective: Initialize backup workflow
  - Mechanism: unknown
2. date_check_task — date_check_task
  - Objective: Determine day of week and select backup strategy
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Inputs: execution_date:Workflow execution date
  - Outputs: branch_decision:Selected backup strategy branch
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
3. full_backup_task — full_backup_task
  - Objective: Perform full database backup
  - Mechanism: shell_command
  - Outputs: backup_file:Full database backup
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
4. incremental_backup_task — incremental_backup_task
  - Objective: Perform incremental database backup
  - Mechanism: shell_command
  - Outputs: backup_file:Incremental database backup
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
5. verify_backup_task — verify_backup_task
  - Objective: Verify backup integrity and completeness
  - Mechanism: shell_command
  - Inputs: backup_file:Backup file to verify
  - Outputs: verification_result:Backup verification status
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
6. backup_complete — backup_complete
  - Objective: Finalize backup workflow
  - Mechanism: unknown

Scheduling:
- Schedule type: cron
- Schedule expression: @daily
- Start date: 2024-01-01
- Catchup/backfill: False
