environmental_monitoring_network_v1 is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern linear. Its purpose is: Integrates station locations with weather, land use, and demographic data to calculate environmental risk scores.

Scheduling: schedule type is manual, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: load_and_modify_stations→geocode_stations; geocode_stations→fetch_historical_weather; fetch_historical_weather→classify_land_use; classify_land_use→fetch_population_density; fetch_population_density→calculate_risk_score; calculate_risk_score→save_environmental_dataset.

load_and_modify_stations performs Ingest and format station data from CSV to JSON using mechanism container_run. geocode_stations performs Geocode station locations using HERE API using mechanism container_run. fetch_historical_weather performs Fetch historical weather data for station locations using mechanism container_run. classify_land_use performs Classify land use type for station locations using mechanism container_run. fetch_population_density performs Fetch population density data for station locations using mechanism container_run. calculate_risk_score performs Calculate environmental risk score based on multiple factors using mechanism container_run. save_environmental_dataset performs Save final enriched dataset to CSV format using mechanism container_run.
