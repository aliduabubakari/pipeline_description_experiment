medical_facility_accessibility_v1 is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern linear. Its purpose is: Geospatial analysis pipeline that processes medical facility locations, geocodes them using HERE maps, and calculates spatial proximity to public transport and residential zones..

Scheduling: schedule type is manual, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: load_and_modify_facilities→geocode_facilities; geocode_facilities→calc_distance_public_transport; calc_distance_public_transport→calc_distance_residential; calc_distance_residential→save_accessibility_data.

load_and_modify_facilities performs Ingest and format medical facility data from CSV to structured JSON using mechanism container_run. geocode_facilities performs Geocode facility addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates using HERE Maps API using mechanism container_run. calc_distance_public_transport performs Calculate spatial distance from facilities to nearest public transport stops using mechanism container_run. calc_distance_residential performs Calculate spatial distance from facilities to nearest residential areas using mechanism container_run. save_accessibility_data performs Save final enriched accessibility data to CSV format using mechanism container_run.
