Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: synthetic-generator-v2__synthetic_staged_etl_01_supply_chain_etl.py
- Name: supply_chain_shipment_etl
- Purpose: Three-stage ETL pipeline for supply chain shipment data processing with vendor data ingestion, cleansing/normalization, and database loading with email notification
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: staged_etl
- Business domain: supply_chain
- Notes: Processes shipment data from three vendors through extract, transform, load stages

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - stage_1_extract -> stage_2_transform
  - stage_2_transform -> stage_3_load
  - load_to_db -> send_summary_email

Data Artifacts / I-O Identifiers:
- file: vendor_a_shipments_20240115.csv (Raw shipment data from Vendor A)
- file: vendor_b_shipments_20240115.csv (Raw shipment data from Vendor B)
- file: vendor_c_shipments_20240115.csv (Raw shipment data from Vendor C)
- table: inventory_shipments (Processed shipment data in inventory database)

Pipeline Steps:
1. ingest_vendor_a — ingest_vendor_a

  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
2. ingest_vendor_b — ingest_vendor_b
  - Objective: Ingest raw shipment data from Vendor B
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Inputs: file:vendor_b_shipments_20240115.csv
  - Outputs: data_object:vendor_b_data
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
3. ingest_vendor_c — ingest_vendor_c
  - Objective: Ingest raw shipment data from Vendor C
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Inputs: file:vendor_c_shipments_20240115.csv
  - Outputs: data_object:vendor_c_data
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
4. cleanse_data — cleanse_data
  - Objective: Cleanse, normalize SKUs, validate dates, and enrich with location data
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Inputs: data_object:vendor_a_data, data_object:vendor_b_data, data_object:vendor_c_data
  - Outputs: data_object:cleansed_shipment_data
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
5. load_to_db — load_to_db
  - Objective: Load processed data to inventory database
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Inputs: data_object:cleansed_shipment_data
  - Outputs: data_object:db_load_complete
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
6. send_summary_email — send_summary_email
  - Objective: Send email summary of ETL processing results
  - Mechanism: notification
  - Inputs: data_object:db_load_complete
  - Step parameters:
    - to=supply-chain-team@company.com
    - subject=Daily Supply Chain Shipment ETL Summary
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
