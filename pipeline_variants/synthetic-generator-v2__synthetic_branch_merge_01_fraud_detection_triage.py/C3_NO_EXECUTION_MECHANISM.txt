Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: synthetic-generator-v2__synthetic_branch_merge_01_fraud_detection_triage.py
- Name: fraud_detection_triage
- Purpose: Processes daily transaction batches for fraud detection by analyzing transaction data, applying risk scoring, and routing transactions based on risk thresholds before merging for final notification
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: branch_merge
- Business domain: fraud_detection
- Notes: Conditional branching with later merge point

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - analyze_transactions -> route_transaction
  - route_transaction -> route_to_manual_review
  - route_transaction -> route_to_auto_approve
  - route_to_manual_review -> send_notification
  - route_to_auto_approve -> send_notification

Data Artifacts / I-O Identifiers:
- file: transaction CSV file (Daily transaction batch file)

Pipeline Steps:
1. analyze_transactions — analyze_transactions
  - Objective: Analyze transaction CSV file and calculate risk score
  - Inputs: file:transaction CSV file
  - Outputs: data:risk_score
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
2. route_transaction — route_transaction
  - Objective: Apply risk model and determine routing based on risk score
  - Inputs: data:risk_score
  - Outputs: control:routing_decision
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
3. route_to_manual_review — route_to_manual_review
  - Objective: Process high-risk transactions through manual review
  - Inputs: control:routing_decision
  - Outputs: data:manual_review_status
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
4. route_to_auto_approve — route_to_auto_approve
  - Objective: Auto-approve low-risk transactions for payment processing
  - Inputs: control:routing_decision
  - Outputs: data:auto_approval_status
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
5. send_notification — send_notification
  - Objective: Send notification after transaction processing completes
  - Inputs: data:manual_review_status, data:auto_approval_status
  - Outputs: notification:processing_complete_notification
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: 5 minutes
