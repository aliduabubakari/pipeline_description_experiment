fraud_detection_triage is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern branch_merge. Its purpose is: Processes daily transaction batches for fraud detection by analyzing transaction data, applying risk scoring, and routing transactions based on risk thresholds before merging for final notification.

Scheduling: schedule type is cron, expression is @daily, start date is 2024-01-01, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: analyze_transactions→route_transaction; route_transaction→route_to_manual_review; route_transaction→route_to_auto_approve; route_to_manual_review→send_notification; route_to_auto_approve→send_notification.

analyze_transactions performs Analyze transaction CSV file and calculate risk score using mechanism python_callable. route_transaction performs Apply risk model and determine routing based on risk score using mechanism python_callable. route_to_manual_review performs Process high-risk transactions through manual review using mechanism python_callable. route_to_auto_approve performs Auto-approve low-risk transactions for payment processing using mechanism python_callable. send_notification performs Send notification after transaction processing completes using mechanism python_callable.
