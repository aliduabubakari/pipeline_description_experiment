Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: synthetic-generator-v2__synthetic_branch_merge_03_regulatory_report_router.py
- Name: regulatory_report_router
- Purpose: Processes financial transaction data and routes it to appropriate regulatory reporting systems based on account type (FATCA for international accounts, IRS for domestic accounts), then archives all reports
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: branch_merge
- Business domain: finance
- Notes: Data Flow: CSV → Account_Check → [International → FATCA | Domestic → IRS] → Archive

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - read_csv -> account_check
  - account_check -> route_to_fatca
  - account_check -> route_to_irs
  - route_to_fatca -> archive_reports
  - route_to_irs -> archive_reports

External Systems:
- filesystem: CSV file storage
- other: FATCA regulatory system
- other: IRS regulatory system
- object_storage: Secure archive location
