Financial Portfolio Rebalancing is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern fan_out_fan_in. Its purpose is: Financial portfolio rebalancing workflow that fetches holdings from multiple brokerage accounts, analyzes each portfolio, aggregates results to calculate rebalancing trades, and generates trade orders.

Scheduling: schedule type is cron, expression is @daily. Control flow includes dependencies such as: fetch_brokerage_holdings_1→analyze_portfolio_1; fetch_brokerage_holdings_2→analyze_portfolio_2; fetch_brokerage_holdings_3→analyze_portfolio_3; fetch_brokerage_holdings_4→analyze_portfolio_4; fetch_brokerage_holdings_5→analyze_portfolio_5; analyze_portfolio_1→aggregate_and_rebalance; analyze_portfolio_2→aggregate_and_rebalance; analyze_portfolio_3→aggregate_and_rebalance; analyze_portfolio_4→aggregate_and_rebalance; analyze_portfolio_5→aggregate_and_rebalance; aggregate_and_rebalance→generate_trade_orders.
