Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: customer_data_quality_scoring_dag
- Name: customer_dq_scoring_pipeline
- Purpose: Generates, cleans, and scores customer data quality
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: fan_out_fan_in
- Business domain: data_quality
- Notes: Performs end-to-end data quality management on customer data including synthetic data generation, cleaning, quality scoring, feature engineering, and reporting

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - generate_synthetic_data -> explore_raw_data
  - generate_synthetic_data -> clean_data
  - clean_data -> calculate_quality_score
  - clean_data -> feature_engineering
  - calculate_quality_score -> save_and_report
  - feature_engineering -> save_and_report
