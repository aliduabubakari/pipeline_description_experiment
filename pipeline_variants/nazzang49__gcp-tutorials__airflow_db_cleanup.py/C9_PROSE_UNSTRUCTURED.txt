airflow_db_cleanup is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern fan_out_fan_in. Its purpose is: Periodically clean out old metadata entries from various database tables to prevent excessive data accumulation in the metadata store..

Scheduling: schedule type is cron, expression is @daily, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: print_configuration→cleanup_DagRun; print_configuration→cleanup_TaskInstance; print_configuration→cleanup_Log; print_configuration→cleanup_XCom; print_configuration→cleanup_SlaMiss; print_configuration→cleanup_DagModel; print_configuration→cleanup_TaskReschedule; print_configuration→cleanup_TaskFail; print_configuration→cleanup_RenderedTaskInstanceFields; print_configuration→cleanup_ImportError; print_configuration→cleanup_BaseJob; cleanup_DagRun→analyze_query.

print_configuration performs Load and validate configuration parameters for the cleanup process using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_DagRun performs Clean up old DagRun entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_TaskInstance performs Clean up old TaskInstance entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_Log performs Clean up old Log entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_XCom performs Clean up old XCom entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_SlaMiss performs Clean up old SlaMiss entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_DagModel performs Clean up old DagModel entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_TaskReschedule performs Clean up old TaskReschedule entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_TaskFail performs Clean up old TaskFail entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_RenderedTaskInstanceFields performs Clean up old RenderedTaskInstanceFields entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_ImportError performs Clean up old ImportError entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_BaseJob performs Clean up old Job/BaseJob entries from the metadata database using mechanism python_callable. cleanup_sessions performs Clean up expired sessions from the session table using mechanism python_callable. analyze_query performs Run database analyze to update statistics after cleanup operations using mechanism python_callable.
