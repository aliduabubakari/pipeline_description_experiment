Pipeline Summary:
- Pipeline ID: synthetic-generator-v2__synthetic_branch_merge_05_content_moderation_pipeline.py
- Name: content_moderation_pipeline
- Purpose: Content moderation pipeline that scans user-generated content for toxicity and routes accordingly
- Execution model: batch
- Topology pattern: branch_merge
- Business domain: content moderation
- Notes: Uses conditional branching based on toxicity threshold (0.7) to route content to different processing paths

Control Flow:
- Dependencies (directed edges):
  - scan_csv -> toxicity_check
  - toxicity_check -> remove_and_flag_content
  - toxicity_check -> publish_content
  - remove_and_flag_content -> audit_log
  - publish_content -> audit_log

Pipeline Steps:
1. scan_csv — scan_csv
  - Objective: Scan CSV file for user-generated content
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
2. toxicity_check — toxicity_check
  - Objective: Check toxicity level and determine routing path
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
3. remove_and_flag_content — remove_and_flag_content
  - Objective: Remove toxic content and flag user account for review
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
4. publish_content — publish_content
  - Objective: Publish safe content to platform
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
5. audit_log — audit_log
  - Objective: Create audit log entry for moderation actions
  - Mechanism: python_callable
  - Failure handling:
    - retries: 2
    - retry delay: PT5M
