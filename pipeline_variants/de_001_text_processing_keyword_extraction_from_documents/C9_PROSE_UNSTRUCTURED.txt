keyword_extraction_pipeline is a workflow with execution model batch and topology pattern linear. Its purpose is: ETL pipeline for document keyword extraction and validation. Generates synthetic documents, cleanses and standardizes them, calculates keyword density and complexity features, validates data integrity, and generates a final report..

Scheduling: schedule type is cron, expression is @daily, catchup/backfill is False. Control flow includes dependencies such as: generate_documents→explore_data; generate_documents→clean_data; clean_data→extract_features; extract_features→validate_data; extract_features→save_and_report; validate_data→save_and_report.

generate_documents performs Generate synthetic document data using mechanism python_callable. explore_data performs Log exploration statistics of raw data using mechanism python_callable. clean_data performs Clean and standardize raw document data using mechanism python_callable. extract_features performs Extract keyword features and metrics from cleaned data using mechanism python_callable. validate_data performs Validate processed data against business rules using mechanism python_callable. save_and_report performs Save final artifacts and log pipeline report using mechanism python_callable.
